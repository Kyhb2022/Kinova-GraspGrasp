This is a project that integrates robotic grasping, speech recognition, and object detection. The experimental results are as follows: (a table). The results show a maximum grasp success rate of 80%, but it is sensitive to lighting conditions and has difficulty grasping objects with smooth surfaces. This project will continue to be improved in the future. If you have any questions or ideas, please contact: whutcec@gmail.com."
